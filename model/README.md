## Brief
Our AI-powered platform simplifies access to government welfare schemes by addressing challenges such as scattered information, lengthy travel, and document verification. It acts as a digital assistant, helping users navigate, verify eligibility, and apply seamlessly.



## Solution

Our AI-powered platform provides a curated and personalized experience by leveraging various AI models to assist users in multiple ways:

- **Personal AI Agent:** Acts as a real-life AI assistant that functions like a phone call, communicating in the user's preferred local language via text and audio, guiding them through available schemes and their application process.
- **Automated Eligibility Check:** Uses AI to verify documents and suggest relevant schemes based on user profiles.
- **Document Assistance:** Users can upload documents for verification and receive guidance on missing or required paperwork.
- **Scheme Recommendations:** AI-driven recommendations based on user demographics, occupation, income, and other key criteria.
- **Multilingual Support:** Ensures accessibility for diverse user groups.
- **CSC and Kiosk Integration:** Enables users in low-connectivity areas to locate the nearest Common Service Centers (CSCs) for offline support.
- **Comprehensive Scheme Filtering:** Users can find schemes based on various filters, including gender, age, income, state, ministry, occupation, education, disability, and more.
- **Indian Sign Language (ISL) Chatbot (Upcoming Feature):** Enhancing accessibility for the deaf community.
